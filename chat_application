I built a simple, secure chat app on Ubuntu using Python. It enables encrypted message exchange between a server 
and client with basic authentication.First, I installed Python 3 and pip, then created a project folder. 
Using OpenSSL, I generated SSL certificates to encrypt communication and protect data from interception.
Wrote two Python scripts: a server that authenticates users and handles messages, and a client that connects 
securely and sends authentication info.Running both in separate terminals, the server verified credentials and 
exchanged encrypted messages with the client. This project gave me practical experience with Pythonâ€™s ssl module 
and secure socket communication.
