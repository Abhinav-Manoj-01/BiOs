Q- Write a program to check whether a string is a palindrome.
Compares the original string to its reverse. A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards.
This can be done by using slicing (`string[::-1]`) to reverse the string and then checking if it matches the original.

Q- Write a program to reverse only the alphabets in a string without changing the position of special characters.
First identify all the alphabetic characters and stores them in a stack or list.
Then, it traverses the original string and rebuilds it character by character. Thus the reversing is done

Q- Write a program to find all pairs in a list whose XOR is equal to a given target.
For each element, it calculates the value that would complete the XOR to match the target 
(i.e., target ^ element). If this complement is already in the set, a valid pair is found.
The result is a list of all such pairs that satisfy the XOR condition.

Q- Write a function that takes two strings and returns True if they are anagrams of each other, and False otherwise.
To determine if two strings are anagrams of each other, the function compares the frequency of 
characters in both strings.It then counts how many times each character appears in both strings. 
If the two frequency counts are identical, the strings are anagrams.
