CryptoHack is a hands-on, puzzle-based platform for learning cryptography. 
This course introduces you to core cryptographic concepts by solving interactive challenges that
blend simple topics like classical ciphers, encodings, and number systems, then move into modern 
cryptography—RSA, hash functions, block ciphers, and real-world attack techniques.
By the end, you’ll understand how cryptographic systems work, where they fail, and how 
to think like a cryptographer or security researcher.
